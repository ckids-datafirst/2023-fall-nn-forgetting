&lt;p>Since we were dealing with a very fundamental issue, we picked a very simple dataset to first reproduce the issue and later research ways on how to fix it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-overview-and-examples">Data Overview and Examples&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We used the Fashion mnist dataset for this problem statement. We also tried to run the system with Cifar-10 dataset. Despite being fairly simplistic in nature, these datasets can be engineered to get a non-IID and IID fractions. Very simply put, IID stands for data that comes from independent, identically distributed dataset. Non-IID is the exact opposite of that. This dataset doesn&amp;rsquo;t share a common distribution. In real life Machine Learning problem statement, the dataset is predominantly Non-IID and also we generally don&amp;rsquo;t know the true underlying distribution of the data. So it is very important that we truly understand this problem and make attempts to solve it.
IID : &lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;img src = 'iid_dataset.png'/>
&lt;p>Non-IID:&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;img src = 'non-iid.png'>
&lt;p>This is simply how we simulate IID and Non-IID dataset from Fashion Mnist data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Problem and Requirements</title><link>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-nn-forgetting/problem-statement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-nn-forgetting/problem-statement/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This page serves as a &lt;strong>Problem and Requirements Document&lt;/strong> for the project. It should be no more than 5 pages long. It should be done after or in combination with the Data Assessment document. It should have an initial release after no more than four weeks into the project, and can serve as an interim project report. It can be refined as the project progresses and the project is better understood.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The project advisor should have provided the general context for the project, the kinds of problems that could be addressed using the data available, and the overall motivation for working in this area.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problem-for-the-semester">Problem for the Semester&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While the motivation section typically describes the long-term reasons to tackle this project, the problem section should focus on the specific problem and goals selected for the current semester. It should be a realistic goal that can be accomplished with the resources available, and this typically means the data, the people, the time available. It is useful to be specific about the initial questions that will be addressed first, because those typically lead to a better understanding of what other questions could be tackled. This will help establish a clear scope for the project that will give everyone reasonable confidence of what the team can achieve. It is also very useful to describe what the team is not going to tackle and has agreed to leave for future work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="state-of-the-art">State of the Art&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Provide a brief summary or survey of the possible approaches, advances, or tools that are currently available that could potentially be used to address the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="design-and-approach">Design and Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Discuss the initial approach that the team will follow. This may include the key idea that the team believes could potentially work, and a high-level description of 1) the system to be built and a diagram of its components, 2) the inputs to the system and the task that it will do with that data, and 3) the outputs to be generated. Discuss also a baseline system that is simple and can be quickly built to address the problem in a reasonable way even if it has poor performance, so that you can clearly show improvements. Discuss also how those improvements will be demonstrated through metrics or other means.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use-case-scenario">Use Case Scenario&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Show with a use case scenario with examples of who the ultimate users could be, what the system that you plan to build for the semester will do in that scenario. Provide a mockup of the outputs for the use case that you propose.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="desired-outcomes-and-benefits">Desired Outcomes and Benefits&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Connect back the system that you will be building with the initial motivation for the work, and what additional future work might be needed in order for the system to provide benefits to its users.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Results</title><link>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-nn-forgetting/results/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-nn-forgetting/results/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page contains key sections of the &lt;strong>Final Report&lt;/strong> for the project focused on results to date. It should be no more than 2 pages long. An initial draft can be created at any point during the project, and can be refined as the project progresses.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Show the performance of the best system and model(s) developed, showing clearly the performance metrics and improvements over the baseline system as appropriate. Create visualizations that show clearly these results.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Offer a discussion of the main findings using the system developed. Put the results in the context of the original problem statement and the questions that were posed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discuss any unexpected results, and potential explanations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enumerate (ideally in bullets) the most important findings, and their impact on your project goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="limitations-and-future-work">Limitations and Future Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Discuss any limitations of the work to date, how these limitations could be addressed in future work. Discuss what lines of work are most promising given the understanding of the problem and the data gained throughout the project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
