      text: This project focuses on two main goals. First, it aims to understand and solve the problem of catastrophic unlearning, which happens when pre-trained models forget what they have learned during further training. Second, we want to examine the ways to handle community drift, a challenge that occurs in Federated Learning when data is not evenly distributed across different clients. As a whole, we try to find a way to solve the first problem statement in hopes that it will help to counter the second problem, the community drift.
