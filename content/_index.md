        This project addresses the problem of catastrophic unlearning in Neural Networks. Forgetting is a natural by-product resulting from an attempt to generalize across data instances. We are not making the networks memorize, are we? We study about a different type of unlearning. <br>
        Catastrophic unlearning happens in certain scenarios like in Fed-Avg algorithm in Non-IID Scenario. This research project was our attempt in understanding why it happens and how it can be reduced in a controlled setting.
