## Introduction

Since we were dealing with a very fundamental issue, we picked a very simple dataset to first reproduce the issue and later research ways on how to fix it.

## Data Overview and Examples

We used the fashion mnist dataset for this problem statement. We also tried to run the system with Cifar-10 dataset. Despite being fairly simplistic in nature, these dataset have an abundance of information enough to simulate the non-IID unlearning scenario.

## Data Accessibility

Summarize how the data can be accessed. For example, data may be available for download in files, or accessible through an API, or can be queried from a database.  Mention any restrictions in accessing the data, for example if it is sensitive data that can only accessed with special permission.

## Data Formats

Describe briefly the formats of the data.  Common data formats include CSV, JSON, XML, shapefiles, or any other specific formats relevant to your website.

## Data Challenges

Summarize why analyzing this data will be challenging. This may include issues like data heterogeneity, data size, and any pre- or post-processing needs. Explain some ideas for how these challenges could be addressed.

## Data Visualizations and Highlights

Including a visualization is a simple way to show something interesting about the data.  Perhaps the visualizations could simply highlight the size, distribution, and other simple statistical characteristics of the data.
